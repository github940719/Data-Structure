# Data Structure Course Repository

- This repository is for the **Data Structure** course in the **Department of Information Management and Finance**.  
- It contains implementations and compiled files of classic data structures and algorithms,
  organized as **homework assignments (HW)** and **bonus projects (B)**.
- All programs are developed on **C++ Builder**. If you don't have C++ Builder installed, you can still run the provided **.exe files**, or browse the .cpp files to see my coding style and logic.

## Homework Assignments

- **HW1:** Several sorting algorithms and binary search  
- **HW2:** Generating magic squares using dynamic arrays  
- **HW3:** Implementing Depth-First Search (DFS) using stacks  
- **HW4:** Conversions among infix, prefix, and postfix expressions  
- **HW5:** Singly, circular, and doubly linked lists with special operations (e.g., reversal)  
- **HW6:** Search, insertion, and deletion in unbalanced Binary Search Trees (BST) and balanced AVL trees  
- **HW7:** Single-source and all-pairs shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm and dynamic programming  
- **HW8:** Various sorting algorithms and comparison of their execution times  

## Bonus Projects

- **B01:** Fast exponentiation and fast polynomial multiplication  
- **B02:** Generating knight’s tour using dynamic arrays and heuristic rules  
- **B03:** Classic n-queen problem solved with backtracking (DFS)  
- **B04:** Polynomial addition using circular singly linked lists (efficient for sparse polynomials)  
- **B05:** Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) generation using Kruskal’s algorithm (with min heap and union-find) and Prim’s algorithm,
  with execution time comparison on  sparse and dense graphs
