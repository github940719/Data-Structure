this repository is for Data Structure, a course in Department of Information Management and Finance.
it contains various implementations and the resulting .exe file of classic data structures and algorithms, organized as homework assignments (HW) and bonus projects (B).

HW1: some sorting algorithms, and binary search
HW2: use dynamic array to generate the magic square
HW3: use stack to implement DFS
HW4: all transformations among infix, prefix, and postfix
HW5: singly / circular / double linked list with special operations (e.g. reverse)
HW6: search / insertion / deletion of (unbalanced) BST and (balanced) AVL tree 
HW7: use Dijkstra's algorithm / dynamic programming to implement single source / all-pair shortest path
HW8: various sorting algorithm and comparison of their execution time

B01: fast power, fast polynomial
B02: use dynamic array to generate the knight tour (by experience rule)
B03: use back-tracking (DFS) to implement classic n-queen problem 
B04: use circular singly linked list to implement polynomial addition (efficient for sparse polynomial)
B05: use Kruskal's (with min heap and union-find) and Prim's algorithm to generate MST, and compare their execution time (under sparse / dense graph)
